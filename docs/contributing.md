We could use some help with development and testing. We need access to resources to help test firmware;
Because of this, *Drunken Octopus* will need to be a collaborative effort to survive.

Hereâ€™s how you can participate:

-   If you have a LulzBot printer and some toolheads, you can become a
    tester!
-   If you are experienced with Marlin, you can help triage issues and
    build config files!
-   If you are experienced with slicers, you can develop start and end
    GCODE and help others with Cura or other slicers!
-   If you have coding skills, you can help by squashing bugs or
    building binaries!
